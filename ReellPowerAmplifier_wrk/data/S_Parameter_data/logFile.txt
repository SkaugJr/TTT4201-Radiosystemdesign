SP SP1[1] <PowerAmplifier_lib:S-Parameter:schematic>   freq=(100 MHz->6 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/github/ttt4201-radiosystemdesign/adsbibs/jti_caps_s_series/circuit/data/251R14S820_H-SER.s2p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
